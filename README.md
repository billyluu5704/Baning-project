# Banking-project
Create a program for signing in administration and customer banking account with banking functions, and signing up.

You have established your own financial institution to be known as ”UC C++ Program-
mers Bank”. You have arranged and deployed all the necessary hardware infrastructure
required for bank operations. All the bank activities were used to be done manually.
Everything was going fine, then came one day when all the stakeholders of the bank
heard of ”Programming Course 1080C 1021C” at university of Cincinnati. They all
took the course and learned so much about programming and software development
in general that they decide to design software for their Bank’s daily activities. They all
brainstormed the software development process and laid out their development plans
for Banking Software. (CS 1021 coure's project, created by Rohit Pal Singh-professor of the University of Cincinnati)
